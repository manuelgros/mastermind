# Mastermind

A console based version of the game "Mastermind" written in Ruby for The Odin Project.

# Description

Mastermind is a game of skill, in which two players engage in a battle of wits and
logic. In this version you will compete with a computer opponent. One will take on the role of CODEMAKER, who 
creates a secret code, which the other player, who is called the CODEBREAKER, must attempt to discover.
The CODEMAKER generates a code which is made up of four numbers, ranging from 1 to 9
(numbers can be used multiple times). The CODEBREAKER then tries to
guess the code and receives a hint after each attempt:

ðŸŸ¢ if the number at is at its correct position.

ðŸŸ¡ if the number is indeed in the code BUT not at this position

ðŸ”´ if the number is not in the code.

You can choose at the start of each round if you want to play as CODEMAKER or CODEBREAKER.
