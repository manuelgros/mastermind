    puts "WELCOME TO MASTERMIND. Mastermind is a game of skill, in which two players engage in a battle of wits and
    logic. In this version you will compete with a computer opponent. One will take on the role of CODEMAKER, who 
    creates a secret code, which the other player, who is called the CODEBREAKER, must attempt to discover.
    The CODEMAKER generates a code which is made up of four numbers, ranging from 1 to 9
    (numbers can be used multiple times). The CODEBREAKER then tries to
    guess the code and receives a hint after each attempt:

    ðŸŸ¢ if the number at is at its correct position.
    ðŸŸ¡ if the number is indeed in the code BUT not at this position
    ðŸ”´ if the number is not in the code.\n\n".colorize(:light_yellow)
