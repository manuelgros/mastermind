    other player, who is called the CODEBREAKER, must attempt to discover.
    The CODEMAKER generates a code which is made up of four numbers, ranging from 1 to 9
    (numbers can be used multiple times). The CODEBREAKER then tries to
    guess the code and receives a hint after each attempt:
    游릭 if the number at is at its correct position.
    游리 if the number is indeed in the code BUT not at this position
    游댮 if the number is not in the code.\n\n"
