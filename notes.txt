STEPS FOR GAME:

1. A new game is started
2. The computer generates a code to be guessed (Array)
3. Set RoundCount to 0
4. The player can enter his/her name
5. The player can start giving guesses
6. Rounds are being played until either...
  6.1 the player guesses the correct code (PLAYER WIN) OR
  6.2 the game went 8 rounds without a correct guess (COMPUTER WIN)
7. The game finishes 

STEPS FOR EACH ROUND:

1. Player enters a guess (4 integer)
2. Guess is converted into Array
3. GuessArray is checked against CodeArray
    3.1 ClueArray is created
    3.2 GuessArray.each 
        GuessArray[i] = CodeArray[i] ?
          if YES -> ClueArray[i] = ðŸŸ¢
          if NO 
            BUT CodeArray.include?(GuessArray[i]) -> ClueArray[i] = ðŸŸ¡
            OTHERWISE ClueArray[i] = ðŸ”´
    3.3 Add 1 to RoundCount
4. print GuessArray and ClueArray
5. GuessArray all ðŸŸ¢ ?
    if YES -> Game Over / Player Won
    if NO  -> continue
6. RoundCount = 8 ?
    if YES -> Game Over / Player Lost
    if NO  -> continue
7. Next Round...
